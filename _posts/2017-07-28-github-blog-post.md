It's funny. It's been a very long time since I've blogged on a semi-regular basis. Even longer since I've blogged on a regular basis.  I'm not a developer but in my job as a systems  administrator I often find myself visiting github for one reason or another.  When I find myself on github, I remember that I actually have an account and I have the ability to blog using it.  So I think. I'll pop over and add something for no particular reason whatsoever.... thus here I am.
