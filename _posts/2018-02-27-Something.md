I always like to introduce people to podcasts. Lately I've more or less got a "daily" routine of podcasts I listen to.  My podcast player of choice is [PocketCasts](https://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts/). They have a web-based player in addition to an app for both Android and iOS. The thing I like about it is that it is able to sync between devices no matter where you're listening to programs.

I use PocketCasts to automatically download my daily listens and add them to my morning ride playlist.
* NPR's - [Up First](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510318/up-first)
* Cards Against Humanity's - [Good News Podcast](www.thegoodnewspodcast.fm)
* NY Times - [The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/the-daily)

Up First starts with 3 or 4 stories from the previous day, could be politics, arts, world news, but nothing real in depth, usually about 10 minutes long.  Good News is usually less than 5 minutes long, but they give me something random, never heavy, usually humorous, and mostly trivial, but it's nice sandwiched between Up First and The Daily. The Daily is a longer form news based podcast where the writers of the NY Times are invited to give their perspective on some of the current stories they're working on. Lately it's been about gun-rights and the follow up to the shooting in Florida.   It often brings new perspectives that I haven't thought about.

Tomorrow I'll summarize some of my "non-news" podcasts listening.
