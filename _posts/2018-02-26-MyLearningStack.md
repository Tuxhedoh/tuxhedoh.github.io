## My Learning Stack
Around the begining of the year I decided I wanted to spend some time learning some new technology. A lot of times I usually would pick a book or something to help me with my day to day work. Not this time. This time I bought Colt Steele's [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). This course is highly rated and easily has nearly 50 hours of video courses. The course is listed as being $200, but it's regularly sold for under $20. * Note: Don't buy any course on Udemy for full price. I have never seen the courses __NOT__ on sale. *

I started in earnest working through that program and was making progress when I saw a notice on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) about Udacity's [Grow with Google](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google) Scholarship program. I applied one evening while doing something else and forgot about it fairly quickly.  I remembered again when I received an acceptance email with directions to get started. I was one of the 15,000 people accepted into the first round. Out of those 1,500 will be chosen to continue into the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program.  They will announce those people on or around April 11.

I have completed the Udacity course-work and have been spending time in the class forum and slack channel where various students have posted other challenges to keep our skills growing, or helping other students with their questions.

Other programs I've used to assist in learning are:
* [Free Code-Camp](http://freecodecamp.org)
* [Wes Bos' Javascript in 30](http://javascript30.com)
